# PokemonGO-ADB-Snipe
Snipe to a location using ADB.
GPS Joystick from App Ninjas required

I wrote this little script to teleport faster when I'm on the laptop.
And to mitigate the little jumps to reach your destination, I toggle the location.

PoGoSnipeADB.bat - located in the location folder - does the following:
1. Go to [Home] 
2. Disable Location
3. Teleport to input location (starts GPS Joystick)
4. Enable Location
5. Start Pokemon GO.

In the future I'll adjust the script to import a textfile.
So you can teleport using e.g. a field research list.
